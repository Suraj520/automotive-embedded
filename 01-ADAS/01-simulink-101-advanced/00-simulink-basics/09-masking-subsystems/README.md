## About

- Masking subsystem refers to the ability to create a custom interface for a simulink block. 
-It allows you to hide or expose certain parameters and settings for a block and create a user friendly interface for interacting with it.
- It is especially useful when you want to create reusable blocks with customizable parameters.
- In this, we'll create a custom simulink block called "Custom Gain" with a masked interface to set the gain value.
-Add Gain block, Then right-click on the Gain block and select "Mask" -> "Create Mask." This will open the Mask Editor.
- Add parameter as "Gain_value" and "Gain_value" as Name.
- Apply and ok.
