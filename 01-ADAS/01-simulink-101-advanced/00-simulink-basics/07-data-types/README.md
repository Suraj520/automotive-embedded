## About

- Data types are used to specify how numerical values are represented and operated upon in the simulation models.
- These data types define characteristics like the range, precision and behavious or numerical signals in the model.
- Data types are important because they determine how the system handles data during simulations, helping to ensure that that the mathematical ops & calcs are corrrect.

- In this, we'll simulate LED Brightness control using simulink.
