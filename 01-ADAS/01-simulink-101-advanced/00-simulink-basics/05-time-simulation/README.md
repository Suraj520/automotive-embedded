## About

- Time simulation in Simulink is a way to model and analyze the behavior of dynamic systems over time. Time simulation allows uss to understand how a system evolves and responds to inputs over time.

- We'll simulate a basic differential equation for population growth:
```dRabbits/dt = Birth Rate - Death Rate * Rabbits```
