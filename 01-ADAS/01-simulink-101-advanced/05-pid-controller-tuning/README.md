## About

A PID controller is like a smart thermostat for a heating or cooling system in your home. It stands for Proportional, Integral, and Derivative, which are three essential elements that work together to keep a process (like temperature) at the desired level:

- **Proportional (P):** This part acts like a quick responder. It checks how far the current state is from the desired state and adjusts the system accordingly. If the current state is far off, it makes a bigger change to get back on track.

- **Integral (I):** The "I" part is like a long-term memory. It keeps track of past errors between the desired and actual states and tries to fix any accumulated errors over time. It's like making small corrections based on history.

- **Derivative (D):** This part thinks ahead. It looks at the rate at which the system is changing and tries to prevent overshooting the desired state. It's like slowing down when you see a traffic light turning red.

Together, these three components help the controller fine-tune a system by quickly responding to errors, correcting past mistakes, and predicting future changes, just like how your smart thermostat keeps your home temperature just right by adjusting based on current conditions, past history, and potential changes in weather.
